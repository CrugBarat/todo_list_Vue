# Todo List

A simple ToDo List app using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: Vue

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The ToDo list can dynamically add pending 'ToDos' to a list. ToDos can have differing priority, either ↑high or ↓low, which are colour-coded. Specific ToDos can be removed dynamically on completion.

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Your task is to create a todo list application that allows a user to save an item to a list which then renders on the page. Use Vue and Webpack to build a solution.

**MVP**

- Render a list of todos from an array of strings
- Add the capability to add a new todo to the list

**Extensions**

- Update the todos array to take in objects with keys of name and priority
- Add radio buttons to track the level of priority
- Give the user visual feedback on what todos are high priority

---

# Setup

- Download/Clone the repo

- In Terminal, access the todo directory and run:

```
npm install
```
```
npm run build
```

- Open index.html in browser
